# PhotoMaker functionality
App allows you to make a photo and store it in app storage. You won't see images in your gallery, however you'll be able to see them in the app itself with date and name of the image which you gave it.

# PhotoMaker rooms for improvement

I spent about 4 hours on this task as it's been required, so there are some of the things which would take more of my time.

1) Currently photo name is represented as photo ID in the DB. It's actually wrong, better to implement some compound identifier.
2) UIImagePickerController is used whithin Flow, which is wrong, better to move it out of it to separate class which will be Mockable and hence testable
3) UINavigationController inside Flow could be moved to some Mockable class so it'd become more testable.
4) FullScreen image is not really 100% perfect from UI perspective, would mind spending 1 more hour on polishing(remove nav bar, center image, ...)
5) Sourcery proper configuration. I've faced an issue with adding "Import" statements to AutoGenerated which I needed so I basically just copy-pasted what it's generated to Mocks file(It's anyway faster then write this boilerplate on my own). Apparently there are some problems with default Template, but investigation would take more time.
6) Fetching from DB should be ideally performed on the background context with pagination
